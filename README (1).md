## 📘 Abstract

This research investigates the underexplored environmental footprint of AI model inference—specifically, the **water usage involved when users submit prompts to large language models like OpenAI's GPT series**. It includes:
- A realistic simulation model
- Python-based code and visualizations
- Empirical literature review and quotes
- A proposed optimization roadmap

> The findings demonstrate that as model complexity grows, **cooling demands and water usage escalate**, making it crucial to consider energy + water-efficient inference.

## 💡 Highlights

- 🌍 Proposes a **dual-efficiency framework**: energy + water
- 🐍 Includes ready-to-run **Python code and plots**
- 📊 Uses **real-world metrics and scenario modeling**
- 🔁 Encourages **reuse, citation, and collaborative optimization**
